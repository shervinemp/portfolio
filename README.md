# Shervin Naseri - Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills and experience in Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* Tailwind CSS
* PostCSS (for processing Tailwind)
* JavaScript (Vanilla)
* Node.js/npm (for build process)
* GitHub Pages (for deployment)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shervinemp/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Build

To compile the Tailwind CSS into `dist/output.css`:

```bash
npm run build:css
```

This command uses PostCSS and Tailwind CLI to process the styles defined in `src/input.css` and the classes used in `index.html`. The `--minify` flag is included for production builds.
