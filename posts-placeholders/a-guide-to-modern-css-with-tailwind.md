Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that's been gaining a lot of popularity. Instead of pre-styled components, it provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

We'll explore the philosophy behind Tailwind and build a few components to see how it streamlines the development process. This approach can feel different if you're used to frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation, but it offers unparalleled flexibility and can lead to more maintainable and performant stylesheets in the long run. Join us as we build a responsive card component from scratch using only Tailwind's utility classes.
